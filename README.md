# unity.webp

## What's this?

 This project was based in [octo-code/webp-unity3d](https://github.com/octo-code/webp-unity3d).

 I decided that there should be a simpler way and I created **unity.webp**, a plugin that helps you to use [webp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/) in your Unity3d projects in a clear and easy way and works in **iOS, Android, Windows, Linux** projects.
